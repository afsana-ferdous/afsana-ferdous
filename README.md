## About Me

I am a Business Intelligence & Data Analyst specialising in transforming complex datasets into structured, decision-ready insights.

My work focuses on:

- KPI modelling and executive dashboard design  
- Data modelling (star schema, relationships, performance optimisation)  
- Analytical segmentation and clustering  
- Translating business questions into measurable metrics  

I enjoy working at the intersection of business strategy and data — where analytical rigour, clarity, and commercial relevance matter equally.
